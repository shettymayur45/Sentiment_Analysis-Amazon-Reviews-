I've read them in order so far, Shogun and Tai-pan for me were breathtaking, long books which I sped through. Gai-jin was more of a chore, with not much of ending. I found King Rat dull, I think the story wasn't too interesting. Other customers have commented on how harsh the prison was - too be honest, I thought it would've been worse. The King had none of the charisma of the heroes in the other books, and I found myself not really caring whether or not either him or Marlowe made it. Although a lot was made of their inner feelings, this made me feel that they were both just shallow people.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df['label'].value_counts()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"bmRMLKWTwQmx","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718244224150,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":32,"user":{"displayName":"Mayur Shetty","userId":"03155824739995971447"}},"outputId":"b7f1cef6-423c-4e77-8433-561ebda1cd6b"},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["label\n","neg    5097\n","pos    4903\n","Name: count, dtype: int64"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":10}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df['review'][0]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":226},"id":"cwOnBx9yxJYj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718244224151,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":27,"user":{"displayName":"Mayur Shetty","userId":"03155824739995971447"}},"outputId":"99365783-96bd-4aa5-8d6e-e6304460e136"},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'Stuning even for the non-gamer: This sound track was beautiful!

I've read them in order so far, Shogun and Tai-pan for me were breathtaking, long books which I sped through. Gai-jin was more of a chore, with not much of ending. I found King Rat dull, I think the story wasn't too interesting. Other customers have commented on how harsh the prison was - too be honest, I thought it would've been worse. The King had none of the charisma of the heroes in the other books, and I found myself not really caring whether or not either him or Marlowe made it.

I've read them in order so far, Shogun and Tai-pan for me were breathtaking, long books which I sped through. Gai-jin was more of a chore, with not much of ending. I found King Rat dull, I think the story wasn't too interesting. Other customers have commented on how harsh the prison was - too be honest, I thought it would've been worse. The King had none of the charisma of the heroes in the other books, and I found myself not really caring whether or not either him or Marlowe made it.
